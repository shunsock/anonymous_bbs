## Ensuring Anonymity

In many anonymous BBS systems, we can notice same user comments by reading the user's writing style. To prevent this, we replace your comments like "2ちゃんねらー" brefore register your comments to database.

Let's see the example below. Following is the conversation between two users.

```
1: このリポジトリって何？
2: 匿名掲示板だね。相手の素性はわからない状態でチャットできる掲示板
3: ありがとう、使ってみます。
```

In this case, the system replaces the user's comments like below.

```
1: このリポジトリってなんや？
2: 匿名掲示板やで。お互いの素性分からんままチャットできる掲示板や。
1: サンガツ、使ってみるわ。
```

Your writing style is hidden and no one can notice who you are.
